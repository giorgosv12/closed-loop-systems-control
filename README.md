# Closed Loop Systems Control
***

The project consisits of two Parts. In the first part a closed loop system is controled using a PI controller and its
phase portraits are created. The second part includes simulating and controlling a robotic arm with 2 degrees of freedom.


This project contains the reports and the MATLAB code that were developed as part of the _Automatic Control Systems III_ course.
